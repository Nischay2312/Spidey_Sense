# Spidey_Sense

An object detection system based on ultrasonic/sonar waves to detect nearby objects in real-time within a specified range and provide haptic feedback to the user with varying intensity depending upon the proximity of the objects. Initially intended to let the user know if something is behind them or is approaching them just like spider-sense, however upon further thinking this could be adapted for blind people.
